# Git issue 
The main goal of applying this structure is to capture UX work outside of the standard work stream so, as a UX team, we can group, priorities and assert a priority to our work. This will alow us to feed into the main work stream but in addition allow us to track and plan in UX independently.

One issue we face is it's hard to track changes we've established to have a beneficial impact. These are often obfuscated by the "completion" of a project what has tended to leave work in a dark corner gathering dust. This work aims to increase UX maturity within the team and allow us to pull focus back to UX work items that don't get picked up in the initial 

## Summary structure
UX activities broken down via a simple clear structure
three levels of issues
1. top level or epic or design brief - this is the big picture item thats going to guide the work
    - big overarching item
2. Mid level sub issue that break the tasks into simpler tasks - UX task, research , iterative testing steps, 
3. Smaller steps

## Issue structure
- "Project brief" "problem" > "activity", "problems" > "actions"
- labels - epic, task, sub-task

### Level 1
- Project brief - business case, design brief, epic, [Project]
    - labels: ["Project", "UX", "Brief"]
    - What
    - Why
    - Summary goals
    - Business need
    - MVP
    - MVP+
    - What does success look like
    - Does this tie back to the roadmap y/n
- problem - a level 1 or 2 item, a problem can be independent from a project brief. A simple what why problem statement with the addition of helping to define users and scope
    - labels: ["ux", "problem", "activity"] 
    - scope, 
    - users, 
    - evidence

### Level 2
- problem - a level 1 or 2 item
- activity
    - labels: ["ux", "activity"]

### Level 3
- documentation
    - component
    - findings
    - observation
- UX Action
    - 🎯 What needs doing?
    - 🧩 Type category
    - 🗒 Notes (optional)


## Notes and and follow up actions
- Does there need to be an activity type - a generic not problem statement or hypothesis
- add level 3 "pain point" and "Step" issue types
- Add issue types for documentation including - generic, component and findings
- Add "ux-testing-plan" to help build consistent testing plans
- Check if we should we list out services as labels and provide them via issues.
- look into design iteration cycles best practice
- Add labels for "ux", "problem", "activity", "action", "project", "brief"
