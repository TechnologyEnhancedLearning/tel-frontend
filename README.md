# TEL Frontend

Bespoke components and overrides for [NHS.UK Frontend](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend), tailored for Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL) applications within the NHS.

## Overview

`tel-frontend` builds on the NHS.UK Frontend framework as a **peer dependency**, providing:

- TEL-specific SCSS overrides (e.g., custom breakpoints)
- Bespoke TEL components (e.g., cards, banners, etc.)
- Optional templates for demos or GitHub Pages/Storybook

> ⚠️ Note: NHS.UK Frontend must be installed separately in your project.
